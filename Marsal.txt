What is Node?
Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime that enables developers to build dynamic and scalable web applications. It's built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and offers a non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it particularly well-suited for handling concurrent connections and real-time applications. Node.js allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server, facilitating the creation of fast and efficient applications that can handle a high volume of connections with relatively low resource consumption. Its extensive package ecosystem, managed through npm (Node Package Manager), provides a wide range of modules and libraries that simplify common tasks, accelerating the development process. Node.js has gained widespread popularity for its ability to create performant and responsive applications, especially those requiring real-time data processing and interactions.
