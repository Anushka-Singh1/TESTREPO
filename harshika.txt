IMPORTANCE OF Js

1. *Interactive Web Pages:* JavaScript allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web pages. It enables features like form validation, image sliders, pop-up modals, and real-time updates, enhancing user engagement and interactivity.

2. *Client-Side Scripting:* Being a client-side scripting language, JavaScript runs on the user's browser, reducing the need for constant communication with the server. This leads to faster response times and a smoother user experience.

3. *Cross-Browser Compatibility:* JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a reliable choice for building applications that work consistently across different platforms.
