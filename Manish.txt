Computers are probably the most important invention of this century if not of all time. Right now people use computers for just about everything in the world and they are becoming a necessity in peoplesâ€™ lives just as many other new technologies. To say you cannot use a computer this day and age is almost like saying you are illiterate. In order for computers to function and be accessible to people there must be applications or instructions for the computer. In order to make these applications one must write them by programming in a certain computer language. These languages are usually somewhat hard to learn and many people shy away from them. As technology has progressed there has been the development of new and easier programming languages but it is still hard for children and others without much computer experience to learn. Since there is this dilemma in the world today, the many computer scientists and computer experts have come together to discuss new ways of approaching the problem.
